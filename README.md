## Project_2A Title: Classifying multi-page documents [BBC Dataset]
**Objective**: Classify text with one or more classes or categories of a document for making it easier to manage and sort.

**Dataset Link**: BBC_News [http://mlg.ucd.ie/files/datasets/bbc-fulltext.zip]

**Dataset description**: BBC news website collection of stories from five topical areas 
- Consists of 2225 documents from the BBC news website for the years 2004 and 2005.
- Class Labels: 5 (business, entertainment, politics, sport, tech).

**Project Overview**: Text is a rich source of information, but extracting insights from text is challenging and time-consuming due to the unstructured data. With the growing scale of text data in industrial applications, automatic text classification is becoming increasingly
important. Also separating information from the irrelevant can reduce the cost and time of searching and retrieving information from all the documents. In this project, we are aiming to build a model which can categorize the documents to make them easier to manage and sort.

**Tools**: Natural Language Toolkit, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras

**Deployments**: FastAPI, Cloud Application Platform | Heroku, Streamlit, Cloud Computing, Hosting Services, and APIs | Google Cloud
